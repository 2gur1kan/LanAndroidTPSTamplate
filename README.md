LanAndroidTPSTemplate is a third-person shooter (TPS) template designed for Android with LAN multiplayer support using Unity and Mirror. It features mobile-optimized controls, smooth character movement, basic mechanics, and local network (LAN) connectivity for testing and gameplay without internet.

When the host is created, it starts a call on port 8888 and when you start listening to this call, you will automatically connect to the host.
